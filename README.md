# hasev-group-app-responsive

Next.js + TypeScript scaffold for a multilingual marketing website (fr/en/nl/de) with responsive header and mobile burger menu.

How to run:
1. npm install
2. npm run dev
3. Open http://localhost:3000/fr

Notes:
- Logo is placed at /public/logo.png (replace with final PNG/SVG if desired).
- Images on pages come from picsum.photos as placeholders.
- This scaffold uses Tailwind v3.4.14 for compatibility.
- Form uses mailto: (no backend). Consider FormSubmit or an API route for production.
